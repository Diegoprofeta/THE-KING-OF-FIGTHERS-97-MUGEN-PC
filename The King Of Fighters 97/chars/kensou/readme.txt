-- What's this? --

This is Sie Kensou from The king of fighters '98 and '99, adapted for play with
Elecbyte's fighting game engine M.U.G.E.N. by me, NeoGouki (gouki@hem.passagen.se). 

-- What's needed? --

First of all, the newest revision of the M.U.G.E.N. engine which can be found
at http://www.elecbyte.com. Secondly, all the files contained within
the archive kensou.zip which are: 

* kensou.def
* kensou.sff
* kensou.snd
* kensou.cns
* kensou.cmd
* kof94a.act
* kof94b.act
* kof95b.act
* kof96a.act
* kof96b.act
* kof97a.act
* kof97b.act
* kof97c.act
* kof97d.act
* kof98a.act
* kof98b.act
* kof98c.act
* kof98d.act
* kof99a.act
* kof99b.act

Unzip all the files into a sub-directory to the directory where you keep the
M.U.G.E.N. engine called "chars\kensou" and add the character to your
character roster by simply adding the line "kensou" to your "select.cfg"
under the [Characters] section.

-- What's new? --

* Made the proper light attacks link to eachother and themselves, thanks to SorrowEdge for that
  one.
* Further tweaked various velocities such as walking, jumping, running, etc. to match those of
  the original.
* Added the back dash sound that I had overlooked.

-- Comments --

Due to the fact that the QCF, HCB DM is different depending on whether you press A or B the SDM
command has been changed to QCF, HCB + A and B.
