    <span lang="fr">Welcome. If you haven't noticed yet, I'm one of the (not 
      really) numerous M.U.G.E.N. developers out there. Thanks for downloading and 
      trying out Clark Steel from The King Of Fighters 2002 with some KOF'01 &amp; KOF'03 stuff. These games were developed by 
      SNK, now known as 
      SNK Playmore. This is my first attempt at creating a character.<br>
      </span>
      <br>
	  <font size="+1"><b>
      <img border="0" src="images/clark_head.gif" width="38" height="44"></b></font><span lang="fr"><b><font size="3"><img border="0" src="images/2.gif" width="135" height="15"><br>
      <br>
      </font></b>1. This character has been built using sprites and sounds from 
      KOF'99, KOF'02 &amp; KOF'03. Those are <b>copyrighted material</b> <b>and</b> <b>belong to 
      SNK  Playmore</b>. I do not claim property of them for the M.U.G.E.N. 
      use. The Clark Steel M.U.G.E.N. coding files (CNS,AIR,CMD,DEF) are my 
      property though. I would have said the same for the sprite edits but since 
      80 % of the work was done by SNK, I can't get the full credit for them. Of 
      course that doesn't mean that you can use the sprite edits featured in this 
      character without asking me permission.<br>
      <br>
      2. <b>This character has not been built to replace the original character 
      featured in The King Of Fighters</b>. I mean that the original character 
      plays better &amp; is obviously more accurate than this conversion. M.U.G.E.N. 
      does not and cannot replace the original game.<br>
      <br>
      3. This character has been brought to you thanks to the dozens of hours I 
      spent working on him. You can understand that this is hard work, and hard 
      workers hate being stolen. <b>If you wish to use small portions of Clark 
      code for your character, you can do so without my permission, provided that 
      you credit me for what you used. But if you wish to copy a whole move / a 
      special coding technique</b> (I'm not an advanced coder :p) <b>or anything 
      that involves a big piece of code, please contact me first.</b>&nbsp; If the 
      portions you require are ones I also took off other creators' work (with 
      permission of course), ask them directly. <br>
      <br>
      4. <b>Do not host this character on your site or on any other site unless I gave 
      authorization to do so</b>. So far, ShinMugen is the only one allowed to 
      host Clark Steel files (<i>via </i>Mugen DEV board). Of course, do not 
      claim this character is yours just by changing author name as you'd get 
      flamed &amp; buried in the minute by 99 % of the M.U.G.E.N. community.<br>
      <br>
      5. <b>Do not update this character</b>. This aims people who like to take 
      random creations in order to &quot;update&quot; them with stupid super beams, strikers 
      from other games and other shit like that. I am the only one who can update 
      it.<br>
