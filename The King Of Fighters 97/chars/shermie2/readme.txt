-- What's this? --

This is Shermie from The king of fighters '97 and '98, adapted for play with
Elecbyte's fighting game engine M.U.G.E.N. by me, NeoGouki (gouki@hem.passagen.se).

-- What's needed? --

First of all, the newest revision of the M.U.G.E.N. engine which can be found
at http://www.elecbyte.com. Secondly, all the files contained within
the archive shermie.zip which are:

* shermie.def
* shermie.sff
* shermie.snd
* shermie.cns
* shermie.cmd
* kof97a.act
* kof97b.act
* kof97c.act
* kof97d.act
* kof97e.act
* kof97f.act
* kof97g.act
* kof97h.act
* kof98a.act
* kof98b.act
* kof98c.act
* kof98d.act
* kof98e.act
* kof98f.act
* kof98g.act
* kof98h.act

Unzip all the files into a sub-directory to the directory where you keep the
M.U.G.E.N. engine called "chars\shermie" and add the character to your
character roster by simply adding the line "shermie" to your "select.cfg"
under the [Characters] section.

-- What's new? --

* Added some some EnvShake to the Shermie whip (thanks Sunboy).
* Made the Shermie stand / Kourai push the opponent further back.
* Added "edge" to all of Shermie's throws to make them look better when in a corner.

-- Comments --

Once again, there are more palettes than MUGEN can handle at one time, so you're
free to choose the ones you like the best. Shermie has also gotten the "Mary treatment",
which means that you can at any time pull off desperation moves with a weak attack
(takes 1 level of power) and super desperation moves with a hard attack
(takes 2 levels of power). However, if you're low on life (150 or below) you can do DMs
at will and once your power bar reaches level 1 any DM automatically becomes a SDM.
Shermie can also transform into her Orochi incarnation by executing the
"Orochi no chikara o mezameru" command. It costs 2000 in power and lasts for
a limited amount of time.
